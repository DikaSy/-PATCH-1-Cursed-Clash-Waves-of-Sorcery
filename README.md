Cursed Clash: Waves of Sorcery  
This game is a wave-based game based on the famous anime Jujutsu Kaisen authored by Gege Akutami and animated by Mappa Studios. Inspired by the vampire survivors video game. Built using CMU Graphics.

FEATURES:   
There would be 5 characters featured from the protagonists of Jujutsu Kaisen, along with 3 lower-grade enemies, and 3 different bosses.   
Each wave would have a different amount of enemies and it increases as the waves also increase. Every five waves would be a random boss.   
Every kills the player gets and every wave increase would give them points they can spend on the shop to unlock moves and abilities (be careful of a hidden element in the shop).   
There would be 8 moves in total for each character, 4 in the non-awakening phase and another 4 in the awakening phase.   
Every damage inflicted on the enemy by the player would give them an awakening bar that, when it reaches max, would grant them more hp and energy.   
The characters would also have unlockable special abilities that are different from each other.  
Some cutscenes were also included in the moves\!  
Domain clashing when two domains are cast simultaneously.

HOW TO RUN:  
Download the files and keep them inside a folder. Keep the files in this mentioned folder untouched. Ensure that you have cmu\_graphics in the same folder as the file "main.py". Once done, ensure that you have the latest version of Python available and just click on main.py and run the code\!

EXTERNAL LIBRARIES:  
The libraries used in this project are os, pathlib, PIL Image, and cmu\_graphics. Since os and pathlib are already builtin, there is no need for the user to reinstall these libraries. Although PIL Image is required to boost the efficiency of the game, it has already been installed in the cmu\_graphics folder. This also goes for cmu\_graphics. In essence, there are no need for the user to install any additional external libraries as they are already provided in this folder.

BASIC COMMANDS:  
Basic game mechanic keys will be provided in the “Tutorial Menu”

Press ‘enter’ to confirm selection where prompted

SHORTCUTS:  
For some shortcuts to work, some code needs to be uncommented in specific files to make the game balanced.
